                <dd>Diego Armando Maradona (Spanish: [ˈdjeɣo maɾaˈðona]; 30 October 1960 – 25 November 2020) was an
                    Argentine professional football player and manager. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players
                    in the history of the sport, he was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th
                    Century award.[3][4] Maradona's vision, passing, ball control, and dribbling skills were combined
                    with his small stature, which gave him a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than
                    most other players. His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's
                    general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. In addition to his
                    creative abilities, he possessed an eye for goal and was known to be a free kick specialist. A
                    precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname "El Pibe de Oro" ("The Golden Boy"), a name that
                    stuck with him throughout his career.[5] He also had a troubled off-field life and was banned in
                    both 1991 and 1994 for abusing drugs.[6]</dd>
